This SQL code is part of the Google Capstone Project. The initial Analysis was done in Excel and visualisations were done in Tableu.
The data was in 12 individual .csv files which were merged into one. After more research i have found about the 'docked_bike' = 'classic_bike' and that they must have 
starting and ending location. The removal of those lines in the code is the result of this research.
